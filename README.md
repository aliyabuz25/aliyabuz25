<h1>Ali Yabuz (ArbitaryMann)</h1>

<p>
  Security researcher and software developer with a strong focus on <strong>macOS internals, local privilege escalation,
  authorization mechanisms, and low-level system behavior analysis</strong>. I work at the intersection of
  <em>offensive security research</em> and <em>secure backend engineering</em>, with an emphasis on building
  reliable, auditable, and security-first systems.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    🔍 <strong>Research Focus:</strong> macOS authorization services, local privilege escalation vectors, sandbox escape analysis,
    privilege boundary violations, and legacy system security weaknesses
  </li>

  <li>
    🛠️ <strong>Core Technology Stack:</strong> C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Node.js  
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.85;">
      Low-level tooling & debugging: LLDB, Frida, clang/LLVM
    </span>
  </li>

  <li>
    🧩 <strong>Backend Engineering:</strong> RESTful APIs, background workers, real-time systems, authentication flows,
    performance optimization, and secure service architecture
  </li>

  <li>
    🧪 <strong>Security Practice:</strong> Proof-of-concept exploit development, vulnerability research,
    attack surface analysis, misconfiguration auditing, and defensive mitigation design
  </li>

  <li>
    📚 <strong>Technical Writing:</strong> In-depth documentation and technical write-ups focused on macOS security,
    exploit development methodologies, and real-world vulnerability case studies
  </li>

  <li>
    ⚙️ <strong>Primary Development Ecosystem:</strong> .NET-based systems and JavaScript-driven backends
  </li>

<p>
  I prioritize <strong>clarity, correctness, and security-by-default engineering principles</strong> in both research
  and production systems. My work is driven by disciplined experimentation, controlled environments,
  and a strong commitment to ethical security research.
